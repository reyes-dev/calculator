# calculator
This is my calculator project for the Odin Project.
It should work as an basic onscreen calculator.
This program should have add, subtract, multiply and divide functions.
It should have a function that takes two numbers and an operator and calls the necessary add/subtract/multiply/divide functions.
It should have an HTML UI made to look visually appealing in CSS, resembling a handheld calculator, with operator buttons, an "equals" button and a "clear" button.
